Getting started with Clojure
============================

:toc-title: Getting started with Clojure
:source-highlighter: pygments

This document should help guide you through the process to get started
developing with Clojure using https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA]
and the plug-in https://cursiveclojure.com/[Cursive Clojure].  While you do not
absolutely need to use this set-up, it is the one that I believe is the most
approachable.


Install a Java SE Development Kit
---------------------------------

In order to develop Clojure or use IntelliJ IDEA, you will need to install Java
SE Development Kit (JDK) version 1.6 or higher.  Note that a JDK is needed, not
merely a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  You can download the latest JDK
directly from Oracle at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[].

=== Windows

For Windows, just download and run the installer for the latest JDK version.
Be sure to use the 64-bit version if you are running a 64-bit operating system.

=== Mac OS X

As with Windows, just download and run the installer for the latest JDK release.

=== Linux

If you are using Linux, you can use the OpenJDK 7 JDK as an alternative to the
Oracle JDK.


Install IntelliJ IDEA
---------------------

The first step is to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[download IntelliJ
IDEA] for your platform.  The system requirements and installation instructions
are accessible from the download page.

If this is the first time you run IntelliJ IDEA, you will be prompted for a
number of things, such as importing settings, accepting licenses, entering
license information, and finally a number of IDE settings.  Feel free to accept
the defaults for all of these.  However, you can safely disable just about all
of the features for this class.  Doing so should help it run just a bit faster.


.Licensing IntelliJ IDEA
******************************************************************************
By default, IntelliJ IDEA comes with a thirty day license.  If you requested a
student license for RubyMine earlier in the semester, you can use the same
license for IntelliJ IDEA.  If you did not request a student license earlier,
you can easily do so by requesting one with your *na.edu* e-mail address from
https://www.jetbrains.com/student/[].
******************************************************************************


Install Cursive Clojure
-----------------------

Cursive has its own https://cursiveclojure.com/userguide/[Getting Started]
page.  However, I am providing somewhat more detailed instructions.  Now that
you have IntelliJ IDEA installed and set up, you should see a dialogue similar
to the following:

.Initial dialogue
image:startup-dialogue.png[]

Click on the *Configure* drop-down on the lower-right edge and then click on
*Plugins* in the pop-up.  You should now see the following dialogue:

.Plugins
image:plugin-setup-dialogue.png[]

On this dialogue, you will need to click on the *Browse repositories…*
button.  This will bring up the following dialogue:

.Browse Repositories
image:browse-repositories-dialogue.png[]

The next step is to *Manage repositories…*.  You will now get the following
dialogue:

.Custom Plugin Repositories
image:custom-plugin-repositories-dialogue.png[]

Click on the *+* and you will now see the following dialogue prompting you for
a repository URL:

.Add Repository
image:add-repository-dialogue.png[]

Assuming you are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA at the time of this
writing (version 14.1), you will need to type in
`https://cursiveclojure.com/plugins-14.1.xml`.  Feel free to *Check Now* if you
wish, but otherwise simply click *OK* and you will be returned to the 'Custom
Plugin Repositories' dialogue which should now contain the repository you just
added.  Click *OK* there as well, and you will no return to the 'Browse
Repositories' dialogue, which will take a moment to refresh.

You should now be able to scroll down the list to find Cursive and select it,
as in the screen capture below:

.Selecting the Cursive plug-in
image:selecting-cursive.png[]

Once you have found and selected the plug-in, you can install it by clicking on
the green *Install plugin* button.  Just click *Yes* to download and install
Cursive.  You will then see a progress bar as the plug-in downloads.  Finally,
you will return to the 'Browse Repositories' dialogue, but this time where the
*Install plugin* button was, you will now find a button to *Restart IntelliJ
IDEA*:

.Cursive is almost ready
image:restart-to-install-cursive.png[]

Click on *Restart IntelliJ IDEA* and confirm that you want to restart.


Install Leiningen
-----------------

http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] is a build tool for Clojure.  While Cursive
has some support for Leiningen built in, in order to run some tasks, you will
need to have Leiningen installed.

=== Windows

For Windows, you can either use install the
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein.bat[batch
file]  directly or use the http://leiningen-win-installer.djpowell.net/[Windows
installer].

=== OS X

For OS X users, you can either use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] (`brew install
leiningen`).  Alternatively, you can download
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein[`lein`
script] and place it in your path.  You can then invoke `lein` to finish
installation.

=== Linux

For Linux users, you can check if your
https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Packaging[package manager] has
support for Leiningen, but be sure it is version 2.0.0 or higher.  Otherwise,
you will need to download and run the
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein[`lein`
script].


Open the project
----------------

Now that you have most of the tools installed, you can open the project for
this assignment.  Be sure that you have a local copy of this homework
assignment and open using the 'Open' from the main dialogue.  Once the project
has been loaded, you should see a screen similar to the following:

.Project is open
image:opened-project.png[]

Now that you have the project open, there are a few things you need to do
before you are fully up and running.  You will need to set an SDK and configure
the path to Leiningen.


Set an SDK
----------

You can go to the *Run* menu and select the *Run \'REPL'* option.  At this
point, it will most likely complain about the SDK not being specified.

.Missing SDK warning
image:no-sdk-warning-dialogue.png[]

When you click *OK* on that dialogue, it will take you to the 'Project
Structure' dialogue.

.Project structure, Modules
image:project-structure-dialogue.png[]

From here, click on the *Project* on the left side, and you should now see a
*New…* button next to some red text in a section called ‘Project SDK’.

.Project structure, Project
image:project-structure-dialogue-project.png[]

Click on the *New…*, and select *JDK*.  this will bring up a directory chooser.
You will need to go to the directory where Java is installed on your computer.

* For Windows, this should be something like `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_40`.
* On Mac OS X, it should open up to the correct directory
  (`/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home`), so you
  should be able to just *Choose*.
* On Linux, this could be something like `/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64`.


Start a REPL
------------

You should now be able to be able to start a REPL by choosing *Run \’REPL’*
from the *Run* menu.  Go ahead and start one.  You can try evaluating a few
expressions.


Configure Leiningen
-------------------

In order to be able to use Leiningen directly, you will need to tell IntelliJ
IDEA where it can find the project.  To do this, you will need to go into the
main preferences dialouge.  How you get there can vary by platform and the
particular key bindings you chose.  For Windows or Linux, you can try
`Ctrl-Alt-S` or go through *File / Settings…*.  For OS X, you can try `⌘,` or
go through *IntelliJ IDEA / Settings…*.

.Preferences
image:preferences-dialogue.png[]

The easiest way to configure the Leiningen path is to search for Leiningen in
the upper left hand corner.  You can then set the 'Leiningen executable' path.

.Preferences, Leiningen search
image:lein-search-preferences-dialogue.png[]

Now, you wil just need to set that to where you installed Leiningen on your
computer.  If you used the windows installer, this will be in
`C:\Users\YourUserName\.lein\bin\lein.bat`.  If you installed it via Homebrew
in OS X, this will be in `/usr/local/bin/lein`.


Run the assignment
------------------

Now you can close the preferences dialogue.  You can check to see if it all
works by going to *Run / Run…* and then clicking the *Run assignment* option.

.Run assignment
image:run-assignment-dialogue.png[]

It may take a little bit of time for it to get started, but you should finally
see the assignment running.

.Assignment running
image:assignment-running.png[]

Congratulations, you can now open up `homework05.clj` and get started on your
assignment.
